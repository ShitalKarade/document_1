# Licensing and activation

## How Licensing Works
Ignition's licensing is unique and easy to use because Ignition is licensed by the server, not the client. You only need one license for your server; any clients are automatically included. In addition to that, an Ignition license is unlimited and sold based on which modules you want. There are unlimited clients, Tags, and projects. Buy only the modules you need, and don't worry about running into limits. If you want to test other modules, you don't need to do anything extra because of our built-in Trial mode.  All unlicensed modules can be reset in 2-hour trial mode.

## Trial Period
Our goal at Inductive Automation is to provide an easy way to access and learn Ignition. We want everyone to have the opportunity to try Ignition and start working with it with no restrictions. You can download Ignition from our webpage, install it, and start using it for 2 hours at a time.  At the end of the 2-hour time period, all modules will stop running, but don't panic, you can reset the timer to run for another 2 hours.  You can reset the timer as many times as you want, so go for it! The Gateway Webpage and the Designer are not affected by this trial, so you can develop for as long as you want without interruption.  If you do have a license, any unlicensed modules will run in this Trial mode, but licensed modules will never timeout.  
You can re-start the Trial period by logging into the Gateway, and clicking Reset Trial to enable another 2 hours of execution. The Trial Timer may be restarted any number of times. Depending on the module, you may need to take some additional actions. For example, the Vision Clients requires you to log out and back in again in order to continue the Trial.
In the Gateway, the Trial Time banner is displayed near the top of the screen. To reset the trial timer, click the Reset Trial button:

## How to Activate Ignition Standard Edition?
When you purchase a license for Ignition Standard edition, you receive a CD-Key, a six-digit code that identifies your purchase. Use this CD-Key to activate the software online through the Ignition Gateway.  If you later want to add any additional modules, your account is updated and you can re-use your existing CD-Key to activate the new features.  You can also inactivate your CD-Key, and reuse it to activate Ignition on a different machine as many times as you want.  
You can activate your license in two ways:

* **Online Activation** - from the System > Licensing section on the Gateway Webpage, your request to activate your Gateway is activated over the internet. 

* **Offline Activation** - if you don't have an Internet connection, you can follow the manual activation process in the Offline Activation section.
